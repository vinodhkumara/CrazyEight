    <string name="help_menu">Each player is distributed an equal number of cards in the beginning of the play.(Usually 5)
The aim of the game is to dispose off all the cards you have.
A valid card to dispose during your turn is a card with the same suite or same face of the top card.
For example if the current top card is Jack of Hearts , then you can play any heart or any jack.
Eight is special and can be played anytime.
With an eight you also choose which suite the opponent must play the next card.
If you can not play a valid card,then you need to fetch a card from the pile during your turn</string>
